## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Rate Limiting**:

   - YouTube may have rate limits for automated actions
   - The script includes breaks to avoid triggering these limits
   - Adjust timing parameters if you encounter issues

2. **Browser Focus**:

   - Keep the YouTube tab active while the script runs
   - Avoid switching to other tabs/windows
   - Don't minimize the browser

3. **Playlist Size**:

   - Works with playlists of any size
   - Larger playlists will take longer to process
   - Progress is logged in real-time

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Failed deletions are automatically retried
   - Errors are logged to the console
   - Script continues running even if some deletions fail

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Script Stops Working**

   - Refresh the page
   - Wait a few minutes
   - Try running again with increased delays

2. **High Failure Rate**

   - Increase `deletionDelay`
   - Decrease `batchSize`
   - Ensure stable internet connection

3. **YouTube UI Changes**
   - The script may need updates if YouTube changes their interface
   - Check for updated versions of the script

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Customizing for Different Needs

For slower connections:

```javascript
const config = {
  batchSize: 30,
  deletionDelay: 1000,
  batchBreakTime: 1000 * 60 * 3,
  maxRetries: 4,
  debugMode: true,
};
```

For faster connections:

```javascript
const config = {
  batchSize: 75,
  deletionDelay: 600,
  batchBreakTime: 1000 * 60,
  maxRetries: 2,
  debugMode: true,
};
